## About Me

I am an incoming Computer Science Ph.D. student at Stanford University. My research aims to develop machine learning algorithms to understand, treat, and reverse disease. I am partially funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).

Previously, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Vikram Adve (UIUC), Bonnie Berger (MIT), and Morgan Levine (Altos Labs). 


## Research Interests

- Generative Modeling, Geometric Deep Learning, Optimal Transport
