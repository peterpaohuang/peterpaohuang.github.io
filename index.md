## About Me

I am a final year undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Vikram Adve (UIUC), Bonnie Berger (MIT), and Morgan Levine (Altos Labs).

My research aims to develop machine learning algorithms to understand, treat, and reverse disease. Currently, I am working on generative models for single-cell trajectory inference. 

## Research Interests

- Generative Modeling, Geometric Deep Learning, Optimal Transport
- Structural Biology, Single Cell, Molecular Simulation
